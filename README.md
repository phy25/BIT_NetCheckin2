Welcome to contribute to this app.Feel free to clone, fork, commit issues or write docs.

Present BUG includes:

1. Unable to show balance if user didn't logged in with this app(somewhere else like Browser).
Because I need UID to check balance, but I can't access it except from login response, 
and it's labile unfortunately.
2. Notification of "Auth Success" shows again and again when login ok,because of unstable wifi
state when it is just connected.
THANKS a lot for helping fix them.
